Uploaded file requirements:

Data and Annotation files must be .txt or .csv files, and follow standard csv conventions (ie. tab or comma delimeted columns, and newline delimeted rows).
The Data file may include annotations, and their locations must be specified.
The first column of both files should contain a unique identifier for that row.  These identifiers should match the identifiers for that row from the other file.
